openHEVC
========

openHEVC is a fork from smarter's libav git (smarter.free.fr) with only required files from libav to decode HEVC content.
openHEVC in combination with GPAC is used into 3 research projects:
* 4EVER
* H2B2VS
* AUSTRAL

openHEVC is an open source compliant HEVC video decoder created as a fork of Libav for research purposes

How to compile openHEVC on linux from source code
----------
* execute these commands

```sh
git clone git://github.com/OpenHEVC/openHEVC.git
git checkout hm10.0_au
```
* install yasm
* go into OpenHEVC source folder
* execute these commands

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make
sudo make install
```

How to test openHEVC on linux from source code
----------
* Prerequisites: SDL or SDL2
* go into source folder of openHEVC
* with SDL: `cd build; ./hevc -i name_of_annexB_bitstream.(bit,bin,265)`
* with SDL2: `cd build; ./hevc_sdl2 -i name_of_annexB_bitstream.(bit,bin,265)`

How to compile gpac with openHEVC on linux
-----------
* Prerequisites (see http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/2011/04/20/compiling-gpac-on-ubuntu/)
* `svn checkout https://gpac.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gpac/trunk`
* go into gpac source folder
* execute these commands

```sh
./configure 
make
sudo make install
```

How to embed HEVC into MP4 file format
-----------
* use i_main, lp_main, ld_main or ra_main bitstreams from http://ftp.kw.bbc.co.uk/hevc/hm-10.0-anchors/bitstreams/
* `MP4Box -add name_of_annexB_bitstream.(bit,bin,265) -fps 50 -new output.mp4`
  + where fps specifies the framerate (in the case of BQMall_832x480_60_qp22.bin the framerate is 60)
* `MP4Client output.mp4 # to play HEVC mp4 content`

How to embed HEVC into TS
-----------
* use i_main, lp_main, ld_main or ra_main bitstreams from http://ftp.kw.bbc.co.uk/hevc/hm-10.0-anchors/bitstreams/
* go into gpac source folder
* execute these commands:

```sh
cd bin/gcc
./mp42ts -prog=hevc.mp4 -dst-file=test.ts
MP4Client test.ts # to play HEVC transport streams
```
